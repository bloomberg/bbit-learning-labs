    "### What is a portfolio\n",
    "\n",
    "We'll now learn about the final representation and class in our portfolio manager, the portfolio. We've discussed how individuals or institutions can have multiple accounts for different purposes. A portfolio is a collection of these accounts, but also is any collection of investments/financial assets, including stock, bonds, derivatives, ETFs, etc. Accounts are technically a portfolio, but large firms will usually have multiple accounts with different trading strategies. The collection of these accounts represents their portfolio.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, I could have account *Tech Strategy* which contains the positions:\n",
    "\n",
    "***2,000*** shares of ***MSFT USD***,\n",
    "***200*** shares of ***AAPL USD***, and \n",
    "***100*** shares of ***TSLA USD***\n",
    "\n",
    "And an account *Healthcare Strategy* which contains the positions:\n",
    "\n",
    "***1,000*** shares of ***UNH USD***,\n",
    "***200*** shares of ***HCA USD***, and \n",
    "***100*** shares of ***MSFT USD***\n",
    "\n",
    "My entire portfolio is the union of these two accounts. It's important to note that accounts within a portfolio don't need to be mutually exclusive in their positions.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Problem Definition\n",
    "\n",
    "We want to build a class that allows for the management of a portfolio. We should be able to construct a portfolio using a set of accounts and a portfolio name. We should be able to query the portfolio object retrieving the name of the portfolio, a subset of accounts based on a set of account names or return a collection of all accounts. We should also be able to remove/add accounts based on a set of account names or account objects respectively. Removals should ignore non-existent names & additions can replace existing accounts.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Allow for a portfolio to be created with a set of accounts and a portfolio name\n",
    "- Allow for querying of the current portfolio's name\n",
    "- Allow for querying of all accounts within the portfolio\n",
    "- Allow for the querying for accounts in the portfolio that match the filter criteria, returning an iterable\n",
    "    - The user can give a set of account names. Any accounts that match these names should be returned\n",
    "    - The user can give a set of security names or objects. Any accounts that contain one or more positions from the set should be returned\n",
    "    - The user can combine both queries creating a dual filter. Accounts that pass both filters should be returned.\n",
    "- Allow for accounts to be added to the portfolio with a set of account objects. Incoming accounts can replace existing accounts\n",
    "- Allow for the removal of accounts from the portfolio with a set of account names. Names not in the portfolio should be ignored.\n",
    "\n",

    "Your solution will need to follow the interface provided in the lab. Below is a snippet of the interface for securities that you can inherit from. The methods that will be tested are displayed & will need to be overwritten with your implementation. You're free to add more methods then what is displayed in the interface!\n",

    "\n",
    "Once you have completed & saved your solution you can run the test file to validate that your solution works as expected. For the test to run the following need to be true.\n",

    "\n",
    "If you complete your class & have a solution with valid tests try completing the following stretch goals \n",
    "\n",
    "- Update your class init to handle the account set being optional\n",
    "- Add custom implementation for class's __str__ method.\n",
    "- Add a method to remove clear the entire portfolio of all accounts\n",
    "- Develop tests for the new methods created"
