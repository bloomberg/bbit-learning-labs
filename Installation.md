## Installation Instructions

### 1. Installing **Git** (Windows laptop only. Mac OS has Git already installed)

- Navigate to: https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/git-bash
- Download & install the latest version of Git Bash.

### 2. Installing **Docker**

- Navigate to: https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/
- Download & install the right docker engine for your operating system.

### 3. Install your Favorite Terminal (You can skip this step if you already have one installed on your machine)

- You can install **Git Bash**, for example, https://git-scm.com/downloads.

### 4. Fork the GitHub repository and clone it locally.

- In your favorite terminal, clone the repository
  ```
  git clone <GitHubRepo>
  ```
- Navigate into the folder **learning_labs**

### 5. Create a **Docker image** of the BBIT Lab (This might take some time, so have a coffee :) )

- First, ensure that docker is running and then in your favorite terminal, from the folder **learning_labs**, run the following command to build the docker image:

  ```
  docker build . --tag bbitlab
  ```

  **We can remove this step if we publish our image to DockerHub**

### 6. Launch a docker container layer over the docker image of the lab

- launch our container and mount the **learning_labs** folder as a volume to access the lab.

  ```
  docker run --rm -p 8888:8888 -v <full path of the folder 'learning_labs'>:/app bbitlab
  ```

  > Tip: on _Git Bash_ and _macOS Terminal_, use the `pwd` command to
  > get the full path of your current directory.

- When the container fully launches, you should have a similar output.
  You should copy the URL _(circled in red)_ and paste it into your favorite web browser to launch Jupyter Lab.
