There are better fish to fry right now, but it's not as bad as when it had those financial problems.\"\nCarnival Corp. : \"The answer is buy, buy, buy! I'll tell you, they delivered an amazing quarter and didn't get enough credit.\"\nWatch the full lightning round here: show chapters Cramer's lightning round: Buy Becton Dickinson's stock hand over fist 20 Hours Ago | 02:58 ",
