This Southeast Asian country scored top marks in the entertainment, health care and healthy lifestyle categories. Rustam Azmi | Getty Images Ecuador \nThis South American nation offers shoreline and mountain vistas – and it received top grades in the benefits and discounts category, as well as climate. John Elk III | Getty Images Panama \nPanama received the highest ratings for \"benefits and discounts\" and \"visas and residence.\" Outside of Panama City, expatriates can live on $1,500 a month or less, saving money on utilities due to the mild climate. LisaStrachan | Getty Images Mexico \nMexico received a 90 out of 100 in the health-care category. The average doctor visit can run about $30 to $43, while a trip to the dentist costs about $28, according to International Living . CampPhoto | Getty Images Costa Rica \nTaking first place as the ideal locale for retirees, Costa Rica scored top marks in health care and healthy lifestyle. You can also live well on the cheap: $500 a month will get you a furnished two-bedroom home, International Living found. Jeff Diener | Getty Images",
