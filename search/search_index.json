Git is a distributed version control system that helps developers collaborate on projects of any scale. This allows developers to bring a repo full of code down to their workstations, perform their work items, and then put it back into a central server. Commands You'll Need For Today # indicates a comment in bash Check status of changes # See list of files changed git status The git status command displays the state of the working directory and the staging area. It lets you see which changes have been staged, which haven't, and which files aren't being tracked by Git. Upload Your Changes Step 1: Add Files to be Tracked # add files by paths git add [fileName] # OR add file interactively one by one git add -p # OR add all changed files (what you'll do more often than not) git add --all The git add command adds a change in the working directory to the staging area. It tells Git that you want to include updates to a particular file in the next commit. Upload Your Changes Step 2: Save Changes in a Commit # Commit changes with a descriptive commit message git commit -m \"commit description\" Changes are not actually recorded after git add until you run git commit . A commit captures a snapshot of the project's currently staged changes. Committed snapshots can be thought of as \u201csafe\u201d versions of a project\u2014Git will never change them unless you explicitly ask it to. Upload Your Changes Step 3: Push Committed Changes to Remote Repository # Push changes up to remote repo in whatever branch you are working in git push # IF it is your first time pushing, git will show you a message of where to set the push stream git push --set-upstream origin my-new-feature The git push command is used to upload local repository content to a remote repository. Pushing is how you transfer commits from your local repository to a remote repo. Get changes from origin/main to current branch # origin/main => local main git pull origin main The git pull command is used to fetch and download content from a remote repository and immediately update the local repository to match that content An In-Depth Look at Git So why do we need version control? Think about a video game where you've gotten to level 16. But to beat the game completely, you have to make it to level 20. Should you only be able to finish the game if you complete flawlessly it in one try? Of course not. With a version control system you can commit your code, kind of like a checkpoint in a video game, before you actually push it and merge it into your codebase. With version control, you can also roll back to previous commits if you want to change something you did without having to Ctrl+Z 100 times. This is why you should commit often and with detailed commit messages. Some terms you should understand about version control: Version control - known as source control, is the practice of tracking and managing changes to software code. Version control systems are software tools that help software teams manage changes to source code over time Repository or \"repo\" - Each Git project is called a repository, or \u201crepo\u201d for short. A repo stores all the files and changes made to your project. It\u2019s like a project with memory allowing you to move back and forward in time and observe the ways you have changed and modified your project. Thus, the repo stores data and change information. For developers it can be especially useful as they are learning version control systems to practice how to clone a GitHub repository and know how to delete a repository in GitHub. The three big things you do with version control are commit, clone, and branch. When you commit a change, you add your latest changes to your repo and are directing information to be filed. As in life, commitment is a serious responsibility \u2013 and is why every commit needs a serious commit message. A commit message explains changes and is the primary way to communicate changes to your development team. When you commit, you push your changes to the repository, and all information heading upstream to your repo is pushed. This push propels information from your local source into the shared repository. Diffs - Every time you commit there are differences between the project from the last save point to the new one. These changes are called differences, or \u201cdiffs\u201d for short. You can compare changes between commits by looking at the diffs. Merge Conflict - A conflict occurs when two parties change the same file and there's no automatic way to reconcile the changes. You must resolve the change by selecting which change wins. Clone - When you clone a Git repository, you create a local copy to work on and your version will match the contents of the repository at the time you cloned it. For instance, you can clone a repository on GitHub to your computer where you can compile it from source, modify it, and more. Pull - If you've been working on a clone project, you may need to catch up with changes others have made by pulling, which changes revisions from the repository to your local copy. Forking - Another way to copy a repository is called \u201cforking,\u201d and is more like a fork in a tree. Unlike when you clone and make a copy on your computer, forking involves making a new repository, typically on GitHub or whatever hosting site you're using. A fork has all the contents of the original, but you are now the owner of this new repository and you're starting a new development project. You're copying a project when you fork and you're working on a project when you clone. Branch - Branches let you create alternate versions of your project. When you branch you can work on new features and try new ideas without messing with your main work. Consider this \u2013 your main work may have many names and, like a tree trunk, it\u2019s commonly called the \u201cmaster,\u201d \u201cmaster branch,\u201d or \u201cbaseline.\u201d The trunk or master is where your team keeps its primary project development and if it\u2019s messed with, your team will suffer. Thus, if you plan to work on something that will take a while and may break your build, be sure to branch so you don't interfere with the work of others on your team. Open Source - The term open source refers to something people can modify and share because its design is publicly accessible. There are other distributed version control systems that are widely used, for example Mercurial. Instead of typing git before commands, you would use hg for this version control system. The three most popular DVCS (Distributed Version Control Systems) are Mercurial, Git, and Bazaar. Here, we will solely focus on Git. Creating your own Organizations and Repositories You can create a repository for each project you start on your personal GitHub account, but many suggest creating a separate organization for projects you plan to collaborate on or make open-source. QuickStart tutorial for Repositories README Files You can add a README file to your repository to tell other people why your project is useful, what they can do with your project, and how they can use it. If a filed titled README.md file in your repository's hidden .github, root, or docs directory, GitHub will recognize and automatically surface your README to repository visitors. If a repository contains more than one README file, then the file shown is chosen from locations in the following order: the .github directory, then the repository's root directory, and finally the docs directory. Understanding Branches & How to Collaborate Pull Requests Pull requests let you tell others about changes you've pushed to a branch in a repository on GitHub. Once a pull request is opened, you can discuss and review the potential changes with collaborators and add follow-up commits before your changes are merged into the base branch. In order to help your team, make sure you publish your Pull Requests when they're ready with clean code and helpful descriptions``` Merging Merging is Git's way of putting a forked history back together again. The git merge command lets you take the independent lines of development created by git branch and integrate them into a single branch. Note that all of the commands presented below merge into the current branch. Merge Conflicts Merge conflicts happen when you merge branches that have competing commits, and Git needs your help to decide which changes to incorporate in the final merge Keep your code loosely coupled and divide work appropriately to try to avoid merge conflicts as much as possible, though they will eventually be inevitable Rebasing The git rebase command allows you to easily change a series of commits, modifying the history of your repository. You can reorder, edit, or squash commits together. Typically, you would use git rebase to: Edit previous commit messages Combine multiple commits into one Delete or revert commits that are no longer necessary Common Commands You Should Know For more, check out the Git Cheat Sheet First Time Git users Command Action git config -l check your Git configuration - returns a list of information about your git configuration including user name and email git config --global user.name \"Genesis\" Set up your username git config --global user.email \"genesis@gmail.com\" This command lets you setup the user email address you'll use in your commits. git init initialize a git Repo Every Day Commands Command Action git add [file names] First step in pushing changes.

But to beat the game completely, you have to make it to level 20. Should you only be able to finish the game if you complete flawlessly it in one try? Of course not. With a version control system you can commit your code, kind of like a checkpoint in a video game, before you actually push it and merge it into your codebase. With version control, you can also roll back to previous commits if you want to change something you did without having to Ctrl+Z 100 times. This is why you should commit often and with detailed commit messages.","title":"So why do we need version control?"},{"location":"resources/git-basics/#some-terms-you-should-understand-about-version-control","text":"Version control - known as source control, is the practice of tracking and managing changes to software code. Version control systems are software tools that help software teams manage changes to source code over time Repository or \"repo\" - Each Git project is called a repository, or \u201crepo\u201d for short. A repo stores all the files and changes made to your project. It\u2019s like a project with memory allowing you to move back and forward in time and observe the ways you have changed and modified your project. Thus, the repo stores data and change information. For developers it can be especially useful as they are learning version control systems to practice how to clone a GitHub repository and know how to delete a repository in GitHub. The three big things you do with version control are commit, clone, and branch. When you commit a change, you add your latest changes to your repo and are directing information to be filed. As in life, commitment is a serious responsibility \u2013 and is why every commit needs a serious commit message. A commit message explains changes and is the primary way to communicate changes to your development team. When you commit, you push your changes to the repository, and all information heading upstream to your repo is pushed. This push propels information from your local source into the shared repository. Diffs - Every time you commit there are differences between the project from the last save point to the new one. These changes are called differences, or \u201cdiffs\u201d for short. You can compare changes between commits by looking at the diffs. Merge Conflict - A conflict occurs when two parties change the same file and there's no automatic way to reconcile the changes. You must resolve the change by selecting which change wins. Clone - When you clone a Git repository, you create a local copy to work on and your version will match the contents of the repository at the time you cloned it. For instance, you can clone a repository on GitHub to your computer where you can compile it from source, modify it, and more. Pull - If you've been working on a clone project, you may need to catch up with changes others have made by pulling, which changes revisions from the repository to your local copy. Forking - Another way to copy a repository is called \u201cforking,\u201d and is more like a fork in a tree. Unlike when you clone and make a copy on your computer, forking involves making a new repository, typically on GitHub or whatever hosting site you're using. A fork has all the contents of the original, but you are now the owner of this new repository and you're starting a new development project. You're copying a project when you fork and you're working on a project when you clone. Branch - Branches let you create alternate versions of your project. When you branch you can work on new features and try new ideas without messing with your main work. Consider this \u2013 your main work may have many names and, like a tree trunk, it\u2019s commonly called the \u201cmaster,\u201d \u201cmaster branch,\u201d or \u201cbaseline.\u201d The trunk or master is where your team keeps its primary project development and if it\u2019s messed with, your team will suffer. Thus, if you plan to work on something that will take a while and may break your build, be sure to branch so you don't interfere with the work of others on your team. Open Source - The term open source refers to something people can modify and share because its design is publicly accessible. There are other distributed version control systems that are widely used, for example Mercurial. Instead of typing git before commands, you would use hg for this version control system. The three most popular DVCS (Distributed Version Control Systems) are Mercurial, Git, and Bazaar. Here, we will solely focus on Git.","title":"Some terms you should understand about version control:"},{"location":"resources/git-basics/#creating-your-own-organizations-and-repositories","text":"You can create a repository for each project you start on your personal GitHub account, but many suggest creating a separate organization for projects you plan to collaborate on or make open-source.","title":"Creating your own Organizations and Repositories"},{"location":"resources/git-basics/#quickstart-tutorial-for-repositories","text":"","title":"QuickStart tutorial for Repositories"},{"location":"resources/git-basics/#readme-files","text":"You can add a README file to your repository to tell other people why your project is useful, what they can do with your project, and how they can use it.

In python, to create a class we use the keyword class to define a class. For example, let's say I want to create a class called Animal. Within a class, there is a constructor method called __init__ which initalizes a newly created object. Here is an example of a simple class: class Animal: def __init__(self, name): # body of constructor self.name = name def eat(self): print(self.name, \"is eating.\") Saving a Instance Variable and Calling the Variable In python, there is a keyword, self , which represents an instance of a class. This keyword allows you to access variables, methods, and attributes in the class. Let's build out our Dog interface and pass in the name of a dog, and have a function named bark: class Dog(DogInterface): def __init__(self, name) -> None: # Save parameters to instance variable self.name = name def bark(self) -> None: # Print {name of dog} is barking! print(self.name, \"is barking!\") We can access the name initialized in the __init__ method with self . When we want to create an object of this class with a name and call the method, bark() , it can access the name given and print out the statement. Remember, this is an example. You can initialize more variables within any of the class methods and access it through self ! Creating an Interface Python does not have a keyword for interfaces. An interface is an abstract class that defines methods which are not implemented. An interface is implemented in the same way as a class, however, an interface will have abstract methods so you will see the keyword pass in those methods. That means that any subclass will construct those methods how it wants to use them. So two different classes which inherit from the same intergace will inherit the same functions, but can have different implementations. Here is an example of a simple interface: class DogInterface: def __init__(self, name) -> None: # Save parameters to class variables pass def bark(self) -> None: # Print {name of dog} is barking! pass Inheritance Inheritance allows us to define a class that can inherit methods and properties of another existing class or interface. Let us use the example DogInterface from above. Let's create a Dog class that inherits DogInterface: class Dog(DogInterface): def __init__(self, name): # Save parameters to instance variable self.name = name def bark(self): # Print {name of dog} is barking! print(self.name, \"is barking!\") Since Dog is inheriting DogInterface , we implement the methods according to how we want both methods to work. To inherit from another class would have the same initialization, but the child class can have different methods. Let's write a Dog class inheriting the class Animal that was mentioned in the Creating a Class section: class Dog(Animal): def __init__(self, name): self.name = name Since Dog is inheriting Animal , we can use the method eat() on all Dog objects. snoopy = Dog(\"Snoopy\") snoopy.eat() # this will print: \"Snoopy is eating.\" Reading from Command Line Using sys There are a few ways to read arguments from the command line, but we will go over using sys . In this module, there is a variable, sys.argv , which is a list. Some things to note: since sys.argv is a list, we can get the length of arguments with len() sys.argv[0] will be the name of the file given All arguments are strings !
